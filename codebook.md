#* Subject

Numbers 1-30 representing the 30 subjects in the experiment

#* Activity

Each subject performs six different activities while wearing the smartphone: [1] walking [2] walking upstairs [3] walking downstairs [4] sitting [5] standing [6] laying


___

Gyro or ACC : The smartphone embeds two sensor signals for recording the results of activities, accelerometer and gyroscope respectively.

Variables contain X, Y or Z : It is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The values you see are the average of the repeated measurements.
